## About This Project

This repository hosts the code for my personal CV and portfolio website, a dynamic and responsive platform designed to showcase my skills, projects, and journey as a self-taught web developer. It serves as an interactive resume, providing visitors with a deeper insight into my capabilities and passion for front-end development.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** For building a modern, component-based user interface.
- **Vite:** As a lightning-fast build tool and development server, ensuring efficient development.
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring content and styling the application with a clean, minimalist aesthetic.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive elements and application logic.
- **React Icons:** For crisp, scalable vector icons (like the LinkedIn logo!).
- **Git & GitHub:** For version control, collaboration, and project management.
- **Netlify:** For continuous deployment and hosting of the live website.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Interactive Modals:** Dedicated "About Me" and "Contact" modals for detailed information, managed with React's `useState` hook.
- **Clean & Modern UI:** A minimalist design focusing on readability and user experience.
- **Dynamic Content:** Engaging introductory text and call-to-action (CTA) elements.
- **External Links:** Easy access to my LinkedIn profile.

## What I Learned & Challenges Overcome

Building this portfolio from scratch was an invaluable learning experience. Here are some key takeaways and challenges I successfully navigated:

- **React Fundamentals:** Solidified my understanding of functional components, props, state management (`useState`), and side effects (`useEffect`) for interactive UI elements.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Practiced breaking down the UI into reusable components (`Header`, `HeroSection`, `AboutModal`, `ContactModal`, `LinkedInLogo`).
- **Advanced CSS Techniques:** Gained proficiency in CSS positioning (`fixed`, `absolute`, `relative`), responsive design with media queries, and creating smooth transitions and animations (e.g., modal animations).
- **Git & GitHub Workflow:** Reinforced best practices for version control, including staging, committing, and pushing changes to a remote repository.
- **Deployment with Netlify:** Understood the continuous deployment pipeline from GitHub to Netlify, ensuring the latest changes are always reflected live.
- **Debugging Build & Rendering Issues:** Successfully troubleshot and resolved common development issues, such as a missing "start" script in `package.json` and ensuring correct SVG icon rendering (`react-icons` vs. plain text). This process significantly enhanced my problem-solving skills.
