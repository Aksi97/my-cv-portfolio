## About This Project: Where My Tech Passion Meets Code

Hi there! I'm Akash Dubey, and this isn't just a website â€“ it's a testament to my journey transitioning into front-end web development. After 5+ years in tech support and payment operations, I decided to dive deep into a new passion: building user-friendly and engaging web experiences.

This portfolio website is the very first project I built from the ground up using **React.js**, and it showcases my foundational skills in web development. It's designed to be a simple, clean, and interactive resume where you can learn more about my background, what drives me, and how my support and problem-solving skills translate directly into crafting code.

## The Tech Under the Hood (What I Learned to Build This!)

Building this site taught me so much, and I truly enjoyed bringing it to life with these technologies:

- **React.js:** This was my first deep dive! I learned to break down complex UIs into smaller, manageable **components** (like the `Header`, `HeroSection`, and those neat `About` and `Contact` `Modals`). I also got hands-on with **React Hooks** like `useState` to manage dynamic content (like opening/closing those modals) and `useEffect` to handle cool user interactions, like letting you close a modal just by hitting the 'Escape' key.
- **Vite:** This tool made my development process incredibly fast and smooth. It handled all the complex setup, letting me focus purely on coding my React components.
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** Beyond just structure and style, I explored **advanced CSS techniques**. I played with `flexbox` for flexible layouts, `positioning` to place elements exactly where I wanted them (like the "HI!" text and the LinkedIn icon), and `transitions` and `transforms` for subtle, smooth animations. Oh, and I also figured out how to create that cool blurry effect behind the modals with `backdrop-filter`!
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** The brain behind the site's interactivity, ensuring everything from button clicks to modal behaviors works seamlessly.
- **React Icons:** I used this library to integrate scalable vector icons, ensuring crisp visuals like the LinkedIn logo, no matter the screen size.
- **Git & GitHub:** This project solidified my understanding of version control. I learned how to track my changes, commit my progress, and push my code to GitHub â€“ essentially creating a living history of my work.
- **Netlify:** A super cool platform that made deploying my website incredibly easy. I learned how to connect my GitHub repo to Netlify for continuous deployment, meaning every time I push an update, my site automatically gets deployed live!

## My Favorite Features & What They Taught Me

- **Interactive Modals (`About` & `Contact`):** These aren't just pop-ups; they taught me how to manage application state (`useState`) and handle user interactions (like clicking the backdrop to close, or preventing clicks inside the modal from closing it). Implementing the 'Escape' key close with `useEffect` was a fun challenge!
- **Responsive Design:** Using `@media` queries in CSS, I made sure my portfolio looks great on any device â€“ whether you're viewing it on a big monitor or a small phone. This involved carefully adjusting layouts and font sizes at different breakpoints.
- **The "HI!" Section & Resume CTA:** Crafting this engaging intro and integrating a direct resume download link required careful CSS positioning and event handling to make it both visually appealing and functional.

## Overcoming Challenges (Because That's Where the Real Learning Happens!)

Every project has its quirks, and this one was no exception! I faced and overcame a few hurdles that really boosted my problem-solving skills:

- **The Missing 'start' Script:** Early on, getting the development server to run properly was a head-scratcher. I learned the importance of checking `package.json` scripts and understanding how build tools like Vite initiate a project.
- **The "Garbage" LinkedIn Icon:** Remember the pixelated icon? That was a fun one! It pushed me to correctly integrate `react-icons` and understand how to properly size and style SVG components, ensuring a crisp, professional look.
- **Deployment Puzzles:** Getting my site to update on Netlify after pushing to GitHub wasn't always instant. This taught me to meticulously check Git push statuses, Netlify build logs, and crucially, to clear my browser cache!

These challenges, though frustrating at the time, were invaluable. They forced me to dig deeper, debug systematically, and ultimately made me a more resilient developer.

## Want to Explore the Code? (Local Development)

If you're curious to see how everything ticks under the hood, you can easily run this project on your machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Aksi97/my-cv-portfolio.git](https://github.com/Aksi97/my-cv-portfolio.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd my-cv-portfolio
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you prefer yarn:
    # yarn install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # (This is the standard Vite command. If you added a custom 'start' script for Vite, you might use 'npm start'.)
    ```
    (The site will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:3000`.)
